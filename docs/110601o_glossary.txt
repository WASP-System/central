I think I am getting a better idea of the moving parts for
project. Below is what I call general glossary I have digested
so far. That of course will be expanded as wasp is being developed.

Things in square brackets ([]) I need some clarification on.

Users are people.
- some Users are Lab Members 
  - Lab Members belong to one Lab [or many?] 
  - Lab Members can submit projects for their Lab.
  - submits a project they become an Investigator.
  - some Lab Members are Primary Investigators (PIs). 
    - PIs approve submitted projects for their Lab.
    - [PIs may create other Lab Members for their lab]
    - [PIs may promote another Lab Member to PI for their Lab] 
- some Users are [Fulfillers]
  - [Fulfillers] perform tasks on the project. 
  - some [Fulfillers] are Administrators
    - Administrators manage billing and accounts
  - some [Fulfillers] are Facilities Techs
    - Facilities Techs manage specific resources (ie. Illumnia)
    - Facilities Techs perform tasks on physical materials. 
- some Users are Chief Administrators (CAs) [not the best of names]
  - CAs may create labs
  - CAs are PIs for all labs.
  - CAs can promote another User to be a CA
- some Users are Facility Managers 
  - Facility Managers can perform all duties of CAs
  - [Facility Managers can perform all duties of Administrators ?]
  - [Facility Managers can perform all duties of Facilities Techs ?]
  - Facility Managers can create Users
  - Facility Managers can promote Users to a Fulfillers, Admins, Facilities Techs, CAs and Facilities Managers
- some Users are System Administrators
  - System Administrators can perform all duties of Facilites Managers
  - [System Administrators will do everything else?]

- Users maybe be any combination of Lab Member and [Fulfiller]

Labs are organization units
  - Labs contain one more more users
  - Labs must contain at least one PI

Projects
  - Projects belong to a single Lab. [shared?]
  - The Lab Member submitting a Project is it's Investigator
  - Projects are accessible to any Lab Member in their Lab
  - Project Workflow are a set of Tasks and order they should be run.
  - Project Inputs are Investigator selections
    - Project Inputs are validated against the Project Workflow.
  - Project Outputs are the results of the Project. 
  - Project Cost is generated based on Project Workflow, Inputs and Outputs.
  - Before beginning
    - Projects must be approved by one of the Lab's PI {task}
    - Projects must be approved by an Administrator {task}
      - approval is a back an forth on Project Costs
      - [Administrators allocate Resources to the Project ?]
    - During this period, Project Inputs can change.
      - [by whom?]
  - some Projects are Sequencing Projects
    - Sequencing Projects need Samples
      - Facilities Techs receive Samples
      - Facilities Techs test if samples are "good".
    - Samples 
      - can be DNA (Macromolecule) Samples 
      - can be Tissue Samples
        - tissue which DNA is originated from 
        - Facilities Tech need to be convert these to DNA Samples {task}
      - Samples Metadata
        - DNA Samples
          - macromolecule preparation
        - Tissue Samples
          - pathology information
          - organism 
          - de-identified patient identifier
    - Libraries [these are physical right?]
      - Facilities Tech generated Libraries from DNA Samples {task}
      - [does multiplexing happen here?, or did it happen before?] {task}
    - Raw Sequence Files
      - Facilities Tech use Sequencer generate Raw Sequence File (QSEQ) {task}
    - Generic Sequence Files
      - System converts Raw Sequence File to Generic Sequence File {task}
    - Demultiplex Sequence
      - If the Generic Sequence is multiplexed, 
        demultiplex it and generate more Generic Sequence Files{task} 
  - some Projects are Assay Projects
    - Assay Projects require a set of Generic Sequence Files
    - Assay Projects require a set of Project Inputs
    - Project Inputs and Generic Sequence are sent to Assay Pipelines {task}
      - Assay Pipelines
        - [this is where i get lost, i assume work is happening.] 
        - Results are sent back.
  - some Projects are both
    - this basically chains the output of Sequencing Projects with Assay Projects
    - most Projects are both
      - by default Assay Piplelines are run on Generic Sequence Files to check for contamination
  - any Project Input or Project Output may be used by a future Project of the same Lab. 


Resources are physical tools.
  - Facilities Techs are in charge of Resources
  - some Resources are DNA Sequencers
    - DNA Sequencers have multiple Lanes
      - each Lane takes a DNA Sample
      - each Lane outputs (eventually) a Raw Sequence File
      - Lanes run together are a Job [or is Job something different?]
        - a Job may be DNA Samples from different Projects
        - a Project need not finish in a single Job
        - Job Metadata
          - this is a 'Lab Workbook' of how the Job was run
  - some Resources are Tissue Sample to DNA Sample Robots
    [i made that up, but can only imagine.]
