		<title>State</title>
		<para>State is a central concept to dealing with data in WASP. Every real
			world event defined within WASP is assigned a state. WASP defines default
			states, but developers can extend the state system to suit their requirements.
			An event's state may simply be a record of progress through a well defined
			series of events in a web-flow, or it can be used to manage interactions
			bet	ween user submissions, human interaction events, and analytical
			processing.

		or define flows of tasks to generate analytical pipelines.</para>
