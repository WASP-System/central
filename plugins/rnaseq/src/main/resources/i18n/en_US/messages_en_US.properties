rnaseq.hyperlink.label==Rnaseq Software Plugin

rnaseq.wf.title=RNA Seq
rnaseq.modifyMeta.title=Modify RNA Seq Metadata
rnaseq.mps.title=MPS Sequencer Options
rnaseq.samples.title=Samples

rnaseq.verify.title=Verify Submission
rnaseq.submit.title=Submit

rnaseq.fraction.label=RNA Fraction
rnaseq.fraction.control=select:total RNA:total RNA
rnaseq.fraction.tt=The facility currently only supports submission of total RNA 
rnaseq.fraction.error=You must provide an RNA Fraction

# rnaseq.range.label=Library Range
# rnaseq.range.control=select:protein coding & lnc RNA:protein coding & lnc RNA;small and micro RNA:small & micro RNA;micro RNA:micro RNA
# rnaseq.range.tt=Library range requested 
# rnaseq.range.error=You must provide an Library Range

rnaseq.requestedDirectionality.label=Requested Directionality
rnaseq.directionality2.label=Directionality
rnaseq.directionality.label=Library Directionality
rnaseq.directionality.control=select:non-directional:non-directional;directional-dUTP:directional-dUTP;directional-ligation:directional-ligation;directional-other:directional-other
rnaseq.directionality2.control=select:non-directional:non-directional;directional:directional
rnaseq.directionality3.control=select:non-directional:non-directional
rnaseq.directionality.tt=State the library directionality method you used or you want the facility to use. If none used or desired, select non-directional. Directional methods permit strand-of-origin identification (such as UTP-based or ligation-based methods). 
rnaseq.directionality.error=You must select a library directionality method

rnaseq.ribosomeDepletion.label=rRNA Removal
rnaseq.ribosomeDepletion.control=select:oligo-dT:oligo-dT;Ribo-Zero:Ribo-Zero;gel fractionation:gel fractionation;other:other;none:none
rnaseq.ribosomeDepletion.tt=State the rRNA removal method that you used.
rnaseq.ribosomeDepletion.error=You must select rRNA removal method
