aligner.star.twoPass.label=perform STAR two-pass alignment
aligner.star.twoPass.error=select a two-pass value
aligner.star.twoPass.control=select:yes:yes;no:no
aligner.star.twoPass.tt=Align against the reference genome, then generate a second reference genome using the splice junctions detected from the previous step \
(see supplement, Engström, et al., doi:10.1038/nmeth.2722).  This step increases sensitivity and may be important for downstream analyses (eg. varinat calling \
RNA-seq results).

aligner.star.clip3pNbases.label=number of bases to clip from 3' of each mate
aligner.star.clip3pNbases.error=a number of bases between 0 and 10 of 3' bases to be clipped should be selected
aligner.star.clip3pNbases.tt=Number of bases to clip from 3' of each mate, this value should be between 0 and 10 and will be clipped from the 3' end of both reads.  By default this value is set to 0.

aligner.star.clip5pNbases.label=number of bases to clip from 5' of each mate
aligner.star.clip5pNbases.error=a number of bases between 0 and 10 of 5' bases to be clipped should be selected
aligner.star.clip5pNbases.tt=Number of bases to clip from 5' of each mate, this value should be between 0 and 10 and will be clipped from the 5' end of both reads.  By default this value is set to 6.
