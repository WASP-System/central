chipSeq.pair.title=IP-Control/Input Pairing
chipSeq.pair.instructions=For purposes of peak calling analysis, you may pair IP (immuno-precipitated) samples with Input/Control samples derived from the same species. Samples designated as species "Other" cannot be paired. While optional, pairing is encouraged where possible. 
chipSeq.pairingNotPossible1.label=For this submission, pairing between your IP and Input/Control samples is NOT possible. Potential reasons include:
chipSeq.pairingNotPossible2.label=Only one sample submitted
chipSeq.pairingNotPossible3.label=No IP samples submitted
chipSeq.pairingNotPossible4.label=No Input/Control samples submitted

chipSeq.replicates.instructions=You may designate biological replicates for IP samples that are paired with a Control/Input. If biological replicates are designated, the reproducibility information they provide will be used during peak calling by invoking the Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) framework. Note that designating biological replicates is optional.

chipSeq.peakType.tt=ChIP-seq peaks for most transcription factors, and for some histone modifications, are punctate (narrow; a few hundred bp). By contrast, for some factors and modifications, peaks can be quite broad (up to tens of thousands of bp), such as for RNA PolII and H3K36me3. Mixed peaks include both types.
chipSeq.inputOrIP.tt=Select IP sample if chromatin for this sample was immuno-precipitated with a specific antibody. Select Input/Control sample if no antibody, pre-immune IgG, or non-specific IgG was used.
chipSeq.antibody.tt=For IP samples, you MUST provide an antibody target (name of target protein or target epitope). 
chipSeq.sonicationFragmentSize.tt=Average sonication fragment size (bp).
