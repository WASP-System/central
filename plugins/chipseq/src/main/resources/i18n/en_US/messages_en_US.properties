chipSeq.replicates.instructions=Designate biological replicates (if any) for IP samples. This information will be used during peak calling to take advantage of the reproducibility information provided by duplicates using the IDR (irreproducible discovery rate) statistic. Note that replicate designation is optional, but encouraged if biological duplicates are available.
