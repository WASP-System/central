chipSeq.replicates.instructions=You may designate biological replicates for IP samples that have been paired (on the previous web page) with a Control/Input sample. This information will be used during integrative analysis, to taking advantage of the reproducibility information provided by replicates using the IDR (irreproducible discovery rate) statistic. Replicate designation is optional, but encouraged if biological replicates are available.
