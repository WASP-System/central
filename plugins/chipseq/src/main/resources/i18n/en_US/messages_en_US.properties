chipSeq.pair.title=IP-Control/Input Pairing
chipSeq.pair.instructions=For purposes of the peak calling analysis, you may pair up IP (immuno-precipitated) samples derived from a species with Control/Input samples derived from the same species. If you do not see a particular Control/Input sample listed, you may have entered its species incorrectly. In addition, samples designated as species "Other" cannot be paired and will not appear below. Note that while pairing is optional, it is encouraged if possible.
chipSeq.pairingNotPossible1.label=For this submission, pairing between your IP and Control/Input samples is NOT possible. Potential reasons include:
chipSeq.pairingNotPossible2.label=Only one sample submitted
chipSeq.pairingNotPossible3.label=No IP samples submitted

chipSeq.replicates.instructions=You may designate biological replicates for IP samples that have been paired (on the previous web page) with a Control/Input sample. This information will be used during integrative analysis, to taking advantage of the reproducibility information provided by replicates using the IDR (irreproducible discovery rate) statistic. Replicate designation is optional, but encouraged if biological replicates are available.

chipSeq.peakType.tt=ChIP-seq peaks for most transcription factors, and for some histone modifications, are punctate (narrow; a few hundred bp). By contrast, for some factors and modifications, peaks can be quite broad (up to tens of thousands of bp), such as for RNA PolII and H3K36me3. Mixed peaks include both types.
chipSeq.inputOrIP.tt=Select IP sample if chromatin for this sample was immuno-precipitated with a specific antibody. Select Input/Control sample if no antibody, pre-immune IgG, or non-specific IgG was used.
chipSeq.antibody.tt=For IP samples, you MUST provide an antibody target (name of target protein or target epitope).
