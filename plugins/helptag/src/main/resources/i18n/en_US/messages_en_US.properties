pageTitle.helptag/description.label=WASP HELP tagging Plugin Description
helptag.maintext.label=Analytical pipeline tool for the HELP tagging assay
helptag.hyperlink.label==Helptag Software Plugin


helptag.wf.title=HELP Tagging
helptag.modifyMeta.title=Modify HelpTag Metadata
helptag.mps.title=MPS Sequencer Options
helptag.samples.title=Samples
helptag.genomes.title=Select Genomes
helptag.cells.title=DNA Sequencer Cells
helptag.aligner.title=Aligner Selection
helptag.comments.title=Comments
helptag.verify.title=Verify Submission
helptag.submit.title=Submit
helptag.pair.title=HpaII vs MspI Pairings
helptag.pair.instructions=Please select HpaII vs MspI for all samples to be analyzed in pairs after sequencing.<br>* By default, all non-paired HpaII samples will be analyzed with universal MspI reference data.
helptag.hapii.label=HpaII
helptag.mspi.label=MspI
helptag.stdref.label=Standard Reference
helptag.selectall.label=Select All
helptag.deselectall.label=Deselect All

helptag.pipeline.title=HELP-tag Pipeline Selection
helptag.pipeline.adpt-mm.label=Mismatches allowed for adaptor sequence
helptag.pipeline.adpt-mm.tt=Max number of mismatches allowed when searching for adaptor sequence on the original sequencing fragment

helptag.pipeline.uniq.label=Number of alignments counted towards HpaII site hits
helptag.pipeline.uniq.select=select:1:1;5:5;10:10
helptag.pipeline.uniq.default=10
helptag.pipeline.uniq.tt=Max number of alignments allowed when counting hits for HpaII sites. Choice "1" means to count unique alignments only at HpaII sites. Choice "5/10" would include multiple alignments with proportional count for each aligned HapII site.


helptag.resenz.label=Restriction Enzyme Used
helptag.resenz.control=select:HpaII:HpaII;MspI:MspI
helptag.resenz.error=You must choose a restriction enzyme

helptag.isAlreadyRestricted.label=Already Restricted?
helptag.isAlreadyRestricted.control=select:no:no;yes:yes
helptag.isAlreadyRestricted.error=Has this genomic DNA been restricted?
helptag.isAlreadyRestricted.tt=When submitting unrestricted genomic DNA and it is to be restricted with MspI and with HpaII by the facility, please enter the sample twice, each time appending either _msp or _hpa to the sample name. For example, if you submit unrestricted genomic DNA whose sample name is abcdefg, please enter two sample records, one sample named abcdefg_msp (and select MspI for its enzyme) and another named abcdefg_hpa (and select HpaII for its enzyme).

helptag.resenz_forGenomicSample.label=Enzyme
helptag.resenz_forGenomicSample.tt=If this genomic DNA sample HAS NOT BEEN RESTRICTED, select the enzyme that you want the facility to use. If this genomic DNA sample HAS BEEN RESTRICTED, select the enzyme that was already used. MOST IMPORTANT: If you submit unrestricted genomic DNA, AND you want the facility to create two samples from the same genomic DNA (one restricted with MspI and another using HpaII), then YOU MUST enter the sample twice, each time appending either _msp or _hpa to the sample name. For example, if you submit unrestricted genomic DNA whose sample name is abcdefg, please enter two sample records, one unrestricted sample named abcdefg_msp (and select MspI for its enzyme) and another unrestricted sample named abcdefg_hpa (and select HpaII for its enzyme).
