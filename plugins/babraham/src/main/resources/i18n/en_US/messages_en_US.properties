fastqc.overrepresentedSeq_plot_title.label=Over-represented Sequences
fastqc.overrepresentedSeq_plot_description.label=A normal high-throughput library will contain a diverse set of sequences, with no individual sequence making up a tiny fraction of the whole. Finding that a single sequence is very over-represented in the set either means that it is highly biologically significant, or indicates that the library is contaminated, or not as diverse as you expected.<br /><br />This module lists all of the sequence which make up more than 0.1% of the total. To conserve memory only sequences which appear in the first 200,000 sequences are tracked to the end of the file. It is therefore possible that a sequence which is over-represented but doesn't appear at the start of the file for some reason could be missed by this module.<br /><br />For each over-represented sequence the program will look for matches in a database of common contaminants and will report the best hit it finds. Hits must be at least 20bp in length and have no more than 1 mismatch. Finding a hit doesn't necessarily mean that this is the source of the contamination, but may point you in the right direction. It's also worth pointing out that many adapter sequences are very similar to each other so you may get a hit reported which isn't technically correct, but which has very similar sequence to the actual match.<br /><br />Because the duplication detection requires an exact sequence match over the whole length of the sequence any reads over 75bp in length are truncated to 50bp for the purposes of this analysis. Even so, longer reads are more likely to contain sequencing errors which will artificially increase the observed diversity and will tend to underrepresent highly duplicated sequences.

fastqc.perBaseQuality_plot_description.label=This view shows an overview of the range of quality values across all bases at each position in the FastQ file.<br /><br />

fastqc.duplicationLevels_title.label=Sequence Duplication Level
fastqc.duplicationLevels_dsName.label=% Duplication
fastqc.duplicationLevels_xAxis.label=Sequence Duplication Level
fastqc.duplicationLevels_yAxis.label=% Duplicate Relative to Unique
fastqc.duplicationLevels_description.label=In a diverse library most sequences will occur only once in the final set. A low level of duplication may indicate a very high level of coverage of the target sequence, but a high level of duplication is more likely to indicate some kind of enrichment bias (eg PCR over amplification).<br /><br />This module counts the degree of duplication for every sequence in the set and creates a plot showing the relative number of sequences with different degrees of duplication.<br /><br />Because the duplication detection requires an exact sequence match over the whole length of the sequence any reads over 75bp in length are truncated to 50bp for the purposes of this analysis. Even so, longer reads are more likely to contain sequencing errors which will artificially increase the observed diversity and will tend to underrepresent highly duplicated sequences.

fastqc.perSequenceQuality_dsName.label=average quality per read
fastqc.perSequenceQuality_title.label=Quality Score Distribution Over all Sequences
fastqc.perSequenceQuality_xAxis.label=Quality Score
fastqc.perSequenceQuality_yAxis.label=Sequence Count
fastqc.perSequenceQuality_description.label=The per sequence quality score report allows you to see if a subset of your sequences have universally low quality values. It is often the case that a subset of sequences will have universally poor quality, often because they are poorly imaged (on the edge of the field of view etc), however these should represent only a small percentage of the total sequences.<br /><br />If a significant proportion of the sequences in a run have overall low quality then this could indicate some kind of systematic problem - possibly with just part of the run (for example one end of a flowcell).

fastqc.perSequenceContent_xAxis.label=position in read (bp)
fastqc.perSequenceContent_yAxis.label=proportion of base (%)
fastqc.perSequenceContent_description.label=Per Base Sequence Content plots out the proportion of each base position in a file for which each of the four normal DNA bases has been called.<br /><br />In a random library you would expect that there would be little to no difference between the different bases of a sequence run, so the lines in this plot should run parallel with each other. The relative amount of each base should reflect the overall amount of these bases in your genome, but in any case they should not be hugely imbalanced from each other.<br /><br />If you see strong biases which change in different bases then this usually indicates an over-represented sequence which is contaminating your library. A bias which is consistent across all bases either indicates that the original library was sequence biased, or that there was a systematic problem during the sequencing of the library.


fastqc.perBaseGcContent_dsName.label=% GC
fastqc.perBaseGcContent_title.label=Per Base GC Content
fastqc.perBaseGcContent_xAxis.label=position in read (bp)
fastqc.perBaseGcContent_yAxis.label=% GC
fastqc.perBaseGcContent_description.label=Per Base GC Content plots out the GC content of each base position in a file.<br /><br />In a random library you would expect that there would be little to no difference between the different bases of a sequence run, so the line in this plot should run horizontally across the graph. The overall GC content should reflect the GC content of the underlying genome.<br /><br />If you see a GC bias which changes in different bases then this could indicate an over-represented sequence which is contaminating your library. A bias which is consistent across all bases either indicates that the original library was sequence biased, or that there was a systematic problem during the sequencing of the library.

fastqc.perSequenceGcContent_ds1Name.label=GC count per read
fastqc.perSequenceGcContent_ds2Name.label=Theoretical Distribution
fastqc.perSequenceGcContent_title.label=Per Sequence GC Content
fastqc.perSequenceGcContent_xAxis.label=Mean GC content (%)
fastqc.perSequenceGcContent_yAxis.label=count per read
fastqc.perSequenceGcContent_description.label=This module measures the GC content across the whole length of each sequence in a file and compares it to a modeled normal distribution of GC content.<br /><br />In a normal random library you would expect to see a roughly normal distribution of GC content where the central peak corresponds to the overall GC content of the underlying genome. Since we don't know the the GC content of the genome the modal GC content is calculated from the observed data and used to build a reference distribution.<br /><br />An unusually shaped distribution could indicate a contaminated library or some other kinds of biased subset. A normal distribution which is shifted indicates some systematic bias which is independent of base position. If there is a systematic bias which creates a shifted normal distribution then this won't be flagged as an error by the module since it doesn't know what your genome's GC content should be.

fastqc.perBaseNContent_dsName.label=% N
fastqc.perBaseNContent_title.label=N content across all bases
fastqc.perBaseNContent_xAxis.label=position in read (bp)
fastqc.perBaseNContent_yAxis.label=% N
fastqc.perBaseNContent_description.label=If a sequencer is unable to make a base call with sufficient confidence then it will normally substitute an N rather than a conventional base call. This module plots out the percentage of base calls at each position for which an N was called.<br /><br />It's not unusual to see a very low proportion of Ns appearing in a sequence, especially nearer the end of a sequence. However, if this proportion rises above a few percent it suggests that the analysis pipeline was unable to interpret the data well enough to make valid base calls.

fastqc.kmer_title.label=Kmer Content
fastqc.kmer_description.label=<br /><br />The analysis of over-represented sequences will spot an increase in any exactly duplicated sequences, but there are a different subset of problems where it will not work:<br /><br /><ul><li>If you have very long sequences with poor sequence quality then random sequencing errors will dramatically reduce the counts for exactly duplicated sequences.</li><li>If you have a partial sequence which is appearing at a variety of places within your sequence then this won't be seen either by the per base content plot or the duplicate sequence analysis.</li></ul>This module counts the enrichment of every 5-mer within the sequence library. It calculates an expected level at which this k-mer should have been seen based on the base content of the library as a whole and then uses the actual count to calculate an observed/expected ratio for that k-mer.

fastqc.sequenceLengthDist_yAxis.label=count
fastqc.sequenceLengthDist_description.label=Some high throughput sequencers generate sequence fragments of uniform length, but others can contain reads of wildly varying lengths. Even within uniform length libraries some pipelines will trim sequences to remove poor quality base calls from the end.<br /><br />This module generates a graph showing the distribution of fragment sizes in the file which was analysed.<br /><br />In many cases this will produce a simple graph showing a peak only at one size, but for variable length FastQ files this will show the lengths. Even within uniform length libraries some pipelines will trim sequences to remove poor quality base calls from the end.<br /><br />relative amounts of each different size of sequence fragment.
