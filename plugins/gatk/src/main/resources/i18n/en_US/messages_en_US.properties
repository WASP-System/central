gatk.maintext.label=genome analysis tool kit broad institute
gatk.hyperlink.label==Gatk Software Plugin

gatk.pipeline.stand_call_conf.label=variant call confidence
gatk.pipeline.stand_call_conf.error=This number should not be empty and should be between 10 to 100
gatk.pipeline.stand_call_conf.tt=The minimum phred-scaled confidence threshold at which variants should be called. The minimum phred-scaled Qscore threshold to separate high confidence from low confidence calls. Only genotypes with confidence greater or equal to this threshold are emitted as called sites. A reasonable threshold is 30 for high-pass calling (this is the default).

gatk.pipeline.stand_emit_conf.label=variant emission confidence
gatk.pipeline.stand_emit_conf.error=This number should not be empty and should be between 10 to 100
gatk.pipeline.stand_emit_conf.tt=The minimum phred-scaled confidence threshold at which variants should be emitted (and filtered with LowQual if less than the calling threshold). This argument allows you to emit low quality calls as filtered records.

gatk.pipeline.max_alternate_alleles.label=The max number of alternative alleles can be called
gatk.pipeline.max_alternate_alleles.error=This number should not be empty and should be between 3 to 1000
gatk.pipeline.max_alternate_alleles.tt=For default, the number is 6; user can increase the number if they have large sample size, especially for INDEL calling

#gatk.pipeline.dcov.label=downsample size
#gatk.pipeline.dcov.error=The downsample size should not be empty and should be between 10 to 2000
#gatk.pipeline.dcov.tt=For default, Unified Genotyper downsamples coverage to no more than 250X, please use the default for WES. For WGS with low coverage, please use 4 times the mean depth

gatk.upload_file_description.label=Please upload the targeted regions of capture assay in bed file format
