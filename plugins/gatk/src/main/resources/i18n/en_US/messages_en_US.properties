gatk.hyperlink.label==Gatk Software Plugin

gatk.pipeline.stand_call_conf.label=variant call confidence
gatk.pipeline.stand_call_conf.error=This number should not be empty and should be between 10 to 100
gatk.pipeline.stand_call_conf.tt=The minimum phred-scaled confidence threshold at which variants should be called. The minimum phred-scaled Qscore threshold to separate high confidence from low confidence calls. Only genotypes with confidence greater or equal to this threshold are emitted as called sites. A reasonable threshold is 30 for high-pass calling (this is the default).

gatk.pipeline.stand_emit_conf.label=variant emission confidence
gatk.pipeline.stand_emit_conf.error=This number should not be empty and should be between 10 to 100
gatk.pipeline.stand_emit_conf.tt=The minimum phred-scaled confidence threshold at which variants should be emitted (and filtered with LowQual if less than the calling threshold). This argument allows you to emit low quality calls as filtered records.

gatk.pipeline.max_alternate_alleles.label=The max number of alternative alleles can be called
gatk.pipeline.max_alternate_alleles.error=This number should not be empty and should be between 3 to 1000
gatk.pipeline.max_alternate_alleles.tt=Maximum number of alternate alleles to genotype. If there are more than this number of alternate alleles presented to the genotyper, then only this many alleles will be used. Note that genotyping sites with many alternate alleles is both CPU and memory intensive and it scales exponentially based on the number of alternate alleles. Unless there is a good reason to change the default value, it is highly recommend that you not play around with this parameter. The default maximum is 6. 

gatk.pipeline.sample_ploidy.label=Sample ploidy
gatk.pipeline.sample_ploidy.error=A value for sample ploidy must be provided
gatk.pipeline.sample_ploidy.tt=Ploidy (number of chromosomes) per sample. For pooled data, set to (Number of samples in each pool * Sample Ploidy).

gatk.pipeline.selectCaller.label=Variant Calling Tool
gatk.pipeline.selectCaller.control=select:hc:haplotype-caller;ug:unified-genotyper
gatk.pipeline.selectCaller.error= You must select one
gatk.pipeline.selectCaller.tt=The Haplotype-Caller (default) is strongly recommended for all cases except for non-diploid genomes for which case the Unified-Genotyper must be used.

#gatk.pipeline.dcov.label=downsample size
#gatk.pipeline.dcov.error=The downsample size should not be empty and should be between 10 to 2000
#gatk.pipeline.dcov.tt=For default, Unified Genotyper downsamples coverage to no more than 250X, please use the default for WES. For WGS with low coverage, please use 4 times the mean depth

gatk.upload_file_description.label=Please upload the targeted regions of capture assay in bed file format
