WASP: New Job Submission
<p>Dear ${addressedTo.firstName} ${addressedTo.lastName},</p>

<p>As a WASP Department Administrator, you are being sent this email to inform you that ${jobSubmitter.firstName} ${jobSubmitter.lastName}, 
a member of the lab headed by ${pi.firstName} ${pi.lastName}, has recently submitted a new job request to the 
Genomics/Epigenomics Shared Facility. The reference number for this submission is J${job.getJobId()} 
and a brief summary of the request appears below.</p>

<p>This email has been sent to all Department Administrators responsible for this lab, any one of which may act upon this request. 
A Department Administrator is required to perform two essential tasks in order to move this job submission forward. These two tasks are:<br />
1. Generate an estimated cost (or quote) for this job and record that cost in WASP<br />
2. If you determine that sufficient funds are available to this Principal Investigator to cover the anticipated cost of this job, 
then approve this submission, otherwise reject it.<br />
</p>
 
<p>To execute these two tasks, <a href="${baseUrl}/auth/login.do">log into WASP</a> and select Tasks from the main menu. You should see  
a list of your tasks.<br /><br />
To generate an estimated cost for this job, click on the Job Quote Tasks link, double click on J${job.getJobId()}, complete the pop-up form, 
and hit the submit button. (If you need to re-quote a job, select Admin from the main menu, then select Quotes.)<br /><br />
Once a job quote is generated, determine whether ${pi.firstName} ${pi.lastName} has sufficient funds to cover the job costs. 
To approve or reject the job based on available funds, select Tasks from the main menu, click on the Department Administration Tasks link, 
choose Job J${job.getJobId()}, indicate either Approved or Rejected, and submit. If you reject this job, please indicate that reason 
in the space provided. Note: That reason will be displayed to the PI and to the job submitter!</p>

<p>Should you have any further questions, please contact us using the information below.</p>

<p>Regards,<br />The WASP Team<br /></p>
